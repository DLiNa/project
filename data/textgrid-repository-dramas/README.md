# textgrid-repository-dramas

* contains the 666 dramatic pieces we extracted from the original TextGrid Repository
  (http://www.textgrid.de/fileadmin/digitale-bibliothek/literatur-nur-texte-2.zip)
* filenames consist of author, title, and year – 'year' being automatically extracted
  from the metadata in the original XML files, sometimes being the year of first
  publication, sometimes just being the lifespan of the author – not really reliable
  information, but good enough for a rough temporal classification of a play
